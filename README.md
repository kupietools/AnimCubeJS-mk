# AnimCubeJS-mk
AnimCubeJS ([https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS](https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS)) is a user-friendly, feature-rich Rubik's Cube simulator you can use in your own web pages.

AnimCubeJS-mk is a custom build of just the AnimCube3.js file incorporating features and customizations:    
1.) Better color options, I think (note: better colors not included in config tool examples, you'll just have to play with it.)    
2.) Florian mod directly integrated    
3.) Markers mod directly integrated
4.) New marker type. Use "5" in the marker specification string to remove the black borders around the marked cubelet. Two "5" marked cubelets next to each other appear to be bandaged together as one continuous piece.
5.) Multi-line move comments from the version posted in the issue at [https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS/issues/43#issuecomment-2336814193](https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS/issues/43#issuecomment-2336814193) directly integrated    
6.) Not minified. You can do that if you need it for production. 

See [AnimCubeJS documentation](https://animcubejs.cubing.net/animcubejs.html) with illustrative examples for more.
