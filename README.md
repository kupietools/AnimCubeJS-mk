# AnimCubeJS-mk
AnimCubeJS ([https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS](https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS)) is a user-friendly, feature-rich Rubik's Cube simulator you can use in your own web pages.

AnimCubeJS-mk is a custom build of just the AnimCube3.js file incorporating features and customizations:    
1.) Better color options, I think (note: better colors not included in config tool examples, you'll just have to play with it.)    
2.) Florian mod directly integrated    
3.) Markers mod directly integrated    
4.) Multi-line move comments from the version posted in the issue at [https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS/issues/43#issuecomment-2336814193](https://github.com/cubing/AnimCubeJS/issues/43#issuecomment-2336814193) directly integrated    
5.) Not minified. You can do that if you need it for production. 

See [AnimCubeJS documentation](https://animcubejs.cubing.net/animcubejs.html) with illustrative examples for more.
